*This is a work-in-progress (WIP) repository, and modifications will be made.*

## 1. Architecture

The demo architecture consists of the following components:

![Demo Topology Diagram](./docs/images/demo2.png)

- **UI / Frontend**: Receives user requests and displays responses.
- **Llama-Stack Server**: Orchestrates interactions with the LLMs and MCP servers.
- **MCP Servers**: Integrate with external systems such as CRM, PDF generation, Process Reports, and Slack.
- **LLMs**: Models (Granite 3.2-8B and Llama 3.2-3B) deployed on OpenShift AI.

### 1.1 Flow Overview

1. The **UI Frontend** receives the user request.
2. The **Llama-Stack Server** processes the request, communicates with the LLMs, and selects the appropriate tools.
3. The **MCP Servers** handle interactions with CRM, PDF generation, Process Reports and Slack.
4. The **LLMs** (Granite 3.2-8B and Llama 3.2-3B) reason over the data and generate a contextualized response.
5. The **UI Frontend** displays the final response back to the user.

## 2. Setup

### 2.1 Prerequisites

* OpenShift Cluster 4.17+
* OpenShift AI 2.16+
